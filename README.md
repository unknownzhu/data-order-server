# data-order-server
Itâ€™s a program for dataBase manager forked from data-gear and adpter to our team made springCloud program.

This branch contains about 80 percents function of datagear and most important differences is that I transferd the database type from derby to oracle.

Now the new struct allows you to use springcloud tools like gateway and oauth2.

And incording  to adapet to our portal website,I tried to use pearadmin program whitch has a fantistic function about creating front and backgroud code with layerui and springcloud.



Then it's about our own function describtion:

1.Data order operation: Creating/review orders to change data or table structs for databases than has been insert into this system.

2.Database structs analyze: Scan the database and persistent database infomation like tableSpace,table structs like table rows count,column info like length,is empty.And after scaning twice or more,system will compare them and show changes.

3.Other functions may has been add suddenly case by our leader and some has been reduced to adapt to customer's use case.They may have not been write in this file and please try to expoler by yourself!
